BUSINESS FORECASTING homework2

3.Data Collection Methodology: 
The Amazon stock data I obtained was collected by Yahoo Finance, the stock data it collects includes date, opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, adjusted closing price, and volume. Yahoo Finance collects Amazon stock data every day, and we can obtain stock data at daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies. And I chose data from nearly five or six years from 2018 to this year and monthly frequency.

4.Why does this data set intrigue you? 
My undergraduate majored in e-commerce and Amazon is a multinational technology and e-commerce giant company. With the continuous development of e-commerce, many analysts also believe that Amazon’s value will continue to grow in the next few years. Stocks can better reflect the development of a company, so I am curious about Amazon’s future development. As an iconic company in the e-commerce industry, the future value trend will also affect or represent the prospects of this industry.
